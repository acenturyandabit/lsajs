# lsajs
Latent Semantic Analysis example in JavaScript

This is a simple implementation of LSA to help me learn the core concepts of the approach to natural language understanding.

# LSA Module

With time, this will become a reusable component for doing LSA, but not just yet!


# Clustering

Options will be added to clustering similar results using hierarchical clustering. This is also used with another NLP module I've been working on, so I will need to work that into a separate module.

Heavily based on [this Python implementation](https://technowiki.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/latent-semantic-analysis-lsa-tutorial).
